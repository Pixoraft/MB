# Render Production Runtime Fix

## Issue Fixed

Your app was failing on Render with the error:
```
Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find package '@vitejs/plugin-react' imported from /app/dist/index.js
```

## Root Cause

The server code was trying to import Vite configuration during production runtime, which requires development dependencies. However, the Dockerfile was removing dev dependencies after the build to reduce image size.

The server imports `viteConfig` from `vite.config.ts`, which imports `@vitejs/plugin-react`. When `npm prune --production` removed dev dependencies, this import failed at runtime.

## Solution Applied

1. **Updated server logic** to only use Vite in development mode and serve static files in production
2. **Modified Dockerfile** to keep all dependencies needed for runtime
3. **Updated render.yaml** to use the production startup script
4. **Used start-production.js** which has proper fallback logic

## Changes Made

### 1. server/index.ts
```typescript
// Before: Used setupVite in both dev and production
if (app.get("env") === "development" || app.get("env") === "production") {
  await setupVite(app, server);
}

// After: Use setupVite only in development, serveStatic in production
if (app.get("env") === "development") {
  await setupVite(app, server);
} else {
  // In production, serve static files
  serveStatic(app);
}
```

### 2. Dockerfile
```dockerfile
# Before: Removed dev dependencies
RUN npm prune --production

# After: Keep all dependencies for runtime
# (The server imports vite config which requires @vitejs/plugin-react)
```

### 3. render.yaml
```yaml
# Before: Used npm start
startCommand: npm start

# After: Use production startup script
startCommand: node start-production.js
```

## How It Works Now

1. **Development**: Uses Vite dev server with HMR
2. **Production**: Serves pre-built static files from `dist/public`
3. **Fallback**: If build fails, falls back to tsx server
4. **Dependencies**: All dependencies stay available for runtime needs

## Deployment Steps

1. **Push changes** to your GitHub repository
2. **Render auto-redeploys** when it detects changes
3. **Check build logs** for successful compilation
4. **Test your app** at the Render URL

## Expected Result

âœ… No more module not found errors
âœ… App serves static files efficiently in production
âœ… All API endpoints work correctly
âœ… Frontend loads properly
âœ… Smaller memory footprint while keeping necessary deps

Your app should now deploy successfully on Render! ðŸš€
