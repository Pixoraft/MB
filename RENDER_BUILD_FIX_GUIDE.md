# Render Build Fix Guide

## Problem Fixed
The Render deployment was failing with error "vite: not found" during the build process.

## Root Cause
- Dockerfile was using `npm ci --only=production` which excludes dev dependencies
- Build tools like Vite and ESBuild are in devDependencies but needed for building
- This caused the build step to fail because Vite couldn't be found

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Dockerfile
Updated the build process to:
1. Install ALL dependencies (including dev dependencies)
2. Build the application
3. Remove dev dependencies after build to reduce image size

### 2. Updated render.yaml
Changed the build command to include the build step:
- Old: `npm install`
- New: `npm install && npm run build`

Changed the start command to use the built version:
- Old: `npx tsx server/index.ts` (runs TypeScript directly)
- New: `npm start` (runs the compiled JavaScript)

## Files Modified
- `Dockerfile` - Fixed dependency installation and build process
- `render.yaml` - Updated build and start commands

## Expected Result
- Render will now successfully build the application
- All dependencies will be available during build
- The app will run the optimized production build
- Build logs should show successful Vite build and ESBuild compilation

## Deployment Steps
1. Commit and push these changes to your GitHub repository
2. Render will automatically detect the changes and redeploy
3. Check the build logs to confirm successful compilation
4. Test all app features after deployment

The build error should now be resolved and your app should deploy successfully on Render!
